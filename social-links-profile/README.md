# Social Links Profile - Frontend Mentor

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my solution for the **Social Links Profile** challenge from [Frontend Mentor]

## What's this?

It's a clean, responsive profile page with social media links. Perfect for linking all your online profiles in one place!

## What I used

- Simple HTML & CSS
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexbox for layout
- Semantic HTML tags

## How to check it out

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. That's it! No fancy setup needed.

## My thoughts

This was a fun little project to practice basic HTML/CSS skills. The design is clean and gives a good foundation to build upon.

Feel free to use this as inspiration for your own version! ðŸ˜Š
